Hi,

Thnk you for giving me this opportunity.

UI phase is in progress and it requires time to fulfill all the requirements. I will keep on committing my changes. I have few things in plan to implement like token authentication between UI and WebAPI in order to provide the basic security and unit test.

Thanks
Hari
